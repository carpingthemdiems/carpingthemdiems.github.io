        		<h1>Hi there, this is my new blog.</h1>
				<p>This is a learner's blog about studying, learning, planning, designing, coding, building software - I will refer to all that as "coding" for short. It is also about doing that while angry. Why angry? Because things happen in life whether you like it or not, and if things happen that prevent you from coding then you might become angry. At some point though you will realize that it isn't the things; it is being angry that prevents you from coding. You are either angry at things or at yourself for not coding - I find one of those cases more stupid than the other. But coding has to happen. <a href="/about">Click here to go to the blog and read more thoughts.</a></p>
